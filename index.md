## Sarah Bania-Dobyns, Ph.D.

As an Educational Strategy Consultant, I consult with clients to uncover stories and use those stories to meet their organization's educational program and curricular needs. I do this by collaborating with mission-oriented clients who seek to shape social policy or respond to educational policy changes that create new challenges for their users/learners. In conversation with clients, I provide thoughtful analysis to inform organizational strategy. I then create the appropriate deliverables to meet the needs of the specific challenge. Deliverables could include (but are not limited to) reports, memos, curricula, e-learning, website copy and metadata, trainings/presentations, slide decks, and briefs. In all cases, I work with clients to choose the right technology to create the deliverables in their organizational voice.
